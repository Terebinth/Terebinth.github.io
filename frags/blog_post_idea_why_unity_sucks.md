Really that's just a jumping off point for some more substantial questions.


Why not use off-the-shelf components ?  For example, Jeremy asked if I had heard of Unity, and recommended it as an option.  Indeed I did research Unity, downloaded and installed it, watched some videos on what it can do, and decided it was most definitely **not** what I wanted to move forward with.  It would be good to qualify and substantiate this claim and view.

More generally, there is the question of whether we are sufficiently leveraging existing technology; we don't want to re-invent wheels unnecessarily, creating undue expendatures.


We'll want to explore these issues in a blog post.
